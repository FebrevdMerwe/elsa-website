title: A Simple Document Approval Workflow 
sidebar_label: Document Approval

In this guide, we will do the following:

* Create an ASP.NET Core application.
* Programmatically define a workflow definition that executes when an HTTP request comes in at a specified URL. Specifically, the workflow accepts a POST request with a JSON payload representing a document to be reviewed.
* See the following activities in action: `HttpRequest`, `HttpResponse`, `Fork`, `Join`, `SetVariable`, `Signaled`, `SendEmail` and `IfElse`.  

Let's get to it!
